Excellent! üéâ Now for the analysis. Nsight Compute's `--set full` report is incredibly detailed. Let's focus on comparing `naive_matmul` (kernel #2) and `tiled_matmul` (kernel #11) to see the impact of your optimization.

Here's what to look for in the Nsight Compute GUI:

***

## 1. Summary Page

* **Select Kernels:** In the **Report** section (usually top left), make sure only `naive_matmul` and `tiled_matmul` are selected (or select them one at a time) so you're comparing the right things.
* **Kernel Duration:** Note the **Duration** for both kernels. You should see a significant reduction for `tiled_matmul`. This is your primary measure of improvement.
* **Top Limiters:** Look at the **GPU Speed of Light (SOL)** section.
    * For `naive_matmul`, what percentage is Memory Bound vs. Compute Bound? It should be heavily Memory Bound.
    * For `tiled_matmul`, has this percentage shifted? Is it more Compute Bound now?
* **Occupancy:** Check the **Launch Statistics** section for **Theoretical Occupancy**. Tiled matrix multiply often uses more registers or shared memory, which *can* sometimes lower occupancy. See if there's a difference.

## 2. Memory Workload Analysis Page

This is crucial for understanding the optimization's effect.

* **Select Section:** Go to the **Memory Workload Analysis** page (select it from the dropdown at the top or the navigation pane).
* **Throughput Charts:** Look at the **Memory Throughput** charts (L1/TEX Cache, L2 Cache, Device Memory).
    * Compare the **Device Memory (DRAM)** throughput between the two kernels. `tiled_matmul` should achieve significantly *higher* DRAM throughput because it reuses data loaded into shared memory, reducing trips to global memory but making better use of the bandwidth when it *does* access it.
* **Cache Hit Rates:** Check the **L1/TEX Cache** and **L2 Cache** sections.
    * `tiled_matmul` should have much higher **L1 Hit Rates** because threads within a block load data into shared memory (`tile` array) and reuse it multiple times.
    * `naive_matmul` likely has poor L1 hit rates as data isn't effectively reused at that level.

## 3. Source Page (Optional but useful)

* **Select Section:** Go to the **Source** page.
* **Correlate Metrics to Code:** Nsight Compute attempts to map performance metrics back to specific lines of CUDA C++ code.
    * For `naive_matmul`, look at the inner loop line: `sum += A[row*N + k] * B[k*N + col];`. You'll likely see high counts for global memory loads associated with this line.
    * For `tiled_matmul` (you'll need the code open separately or hope ncu linked it), compare the lines loading into shared memory (`tile[...] = ...`) versus the lines computing from shared memory (`sum += tile[...] * tile[...]`). The global loads should have fewer transactions overall, while shared memory loads/stores will be high.

## Key Questions to Answer:

* How much faster is `tiled_matmul` than `naive_matmul`? (Check Duration).
* Did the primary bottleneck shift from Memory towards Compute? (Check SOL).
* What evidence shows improved memory access efficiency? (Check DRAM Throughput, L1 Hit Rate).

Start exploring these sections. Let me know what you find for the Durations and the SOL percentages for both kernels! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
